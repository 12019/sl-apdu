Current version is proof-of-concept, usable for debugging.  It might
be best to integrate it into the SIMtrace firmware, which consists of
two parts:

- git://git.gnumonks.org/openpcd.git

ISO7816-3 parser running on the SIMtrace

- git://git.osmocom.org/simtrace

APDU packetizer running on the host.


For the Saleae Logic, both components would run on the host.

How to organize this?  Maybe best to use git subprojects.
